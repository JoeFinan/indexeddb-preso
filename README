All my files (presentation and demos) for my IndexedDB presentation.

1) Note - the trash folder is for random tests that may come up during a presentation. I'm including it in source in case something
interesting ever comes out of it.

2) Note - there is a "bug" in my slide deck that I'll address before I give this presentation again. When you CRUD data, if you wish to 
immediately perform a GetAll type operation, you will want to ensure you listen for the transaction oncomplete.
